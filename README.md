# Topsify

Welcome to Topsify! We're a huge music streaming service with a global user base
and eye-watering amounts of data.

We're so glad you're here - corporate have been asking for reports, stats and
data, but the team is stretched thin at the moment trying to get the UI right.
Let's get working on the database straight away.

The database is in SQL. Before you tackle the backlog, you should take some time
to get up to speed.

## Getting started

1. First up: fork and clone this repo.

1. The database is already populated, but in case you want to start from
   scratch, this is the command you'll need:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 db/topsify.db < db/reset.sql
   ```

1. Have a look at `queries/example.sql` to see how to query the database.

## Database

Here's a glance at how the database is set up.

    users {
        INTEGER id PK "Primary Key"
        TEXT username "Unique"
